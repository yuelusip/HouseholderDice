# HouseholderDice

Julia source code for implementing the **Householder Dice** algorithm.

## Installation:

push!(LOAD_PATH, your_path)

where your_path is the path for the folder "src".

## Examples:

* ista_lasso: Simulating ISTA for lasso on a Gaussian matrix

* spectral_method: Simulating a spectral method on a subsampled random orthogonal matrix

## Reference:

If you use the code in your work, please cite the following paper:

Y. M. Lu, "Householder Dice: A Matrix-Free Algorithm for Simulating Dynamics on
Gaussian and Random Orthogonal Ensembles", [arXiv:2101.07464](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07464), 2021.

Questions are very welcome, as are feature requests and bug reports.
